## About Project
This project is a page about `Mulan - Disney`, one of my favorite princesses. Each page talks about a part of the movie/animation, which can be: the characters, the life story of Mulan and the supporting characters, 
and a playlist with the memorable songs featured in the animation. In addition, the main page features the trailer for the live-action movie!
